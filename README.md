## Question 1: Fractal Distribution and Queries

### Steps:
1. **Run `distr.py`**: This generates a `fractal_distribution.txt` file.
2. **Run `gen_data.py`**: This creates the `trades.csv` data file.
3. **Run `queries.py`**:
   - The script reads the `trades.csv` file.
   - Executes 4 queries (`query_a`, `query_b`, `query_c`, `query_d`).
   - Saves the results to:
     - `query_a.csv`
     - `query_b.csv`
     - `query_c.csv`
     - `query_d.csv`
   - Outputs the execution times on the command line.

### Notes:
- The `typescript` file with logs saved in `crunchy1` is provided in `Queries_Q1.zip`.

   - The script generates `result.csv` (output location can be modified in the script).
3. Verify Results:
   - Queries were tested locally using MySQL.
   - A screenshot of the query execution is attached.

### Files:
- `Result.zip`: Contains the zipped output result file (`result.csv`).
