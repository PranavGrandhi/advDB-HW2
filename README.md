## Question1
Run the distr.py which will save a fractal_distribution.txt file. Then, run the gen_data.py file which will geenrate the data into trades.csv file. All the 4 queries are written in pandas in the file queries.py. This will load the trades.csv file and then save the individual outputs into query_a.csv, query_b.csv, query_c.csv and query_d.csv. The running times are printed on the command line for each. The typescript file that was saved in crunchy1 is zipped in Queries_Q1.zip 

## Question2

## Question3
Sample friends.csv and like.csv are downloaded from the course website. I have used MYSQL to run the required queries and tested locally. If the mapping.sql file is run, (make sure the friends.csv and the like.csv file locations are changed in the script), the result is saved in result.csv (can chnage this location in code as well). I have attached a screenshot of the queries running locally in my laptop. Result.zip is the zipped result file that is the output of the queries
